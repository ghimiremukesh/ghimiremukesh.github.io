The primary objective of this project is to provide energy to the flow over an airfoil so as to delay boundary layer separation which results in increased drag forces causing inefficiencies. It is to be done by the use of actuators (as in the gif above).

The oval loop structure that will house PZT actuator is shown in the figure below. This part will be placed on the surface of the airfoil. When a voltage is applied on the PZT it contracts and expands allowing the oval loop to translate which ultimately provides energy to the flow on the surface.
