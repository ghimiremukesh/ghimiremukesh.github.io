Recently I joined the Composite Research Lab at the University of Mississippi to work on a pultrusion project. Pultrusion combines the words "Pull" and "Extrusion". Hence, it is a process involving pulling action. Pultrusion is a continuous process for manufacturing composites with constant cross-section. The picture shows basic steps of pultrusion process. ![source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:LaurensvanLieshout](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Pultrusion_process_01.png)
