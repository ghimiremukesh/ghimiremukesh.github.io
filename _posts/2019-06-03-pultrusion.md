Recently I joined the Composite Research Lab at the University of Mississippi to work on a pultrusion project. Pultrusion combines the words "Pull" and "Extrusion". Hence, it is a process involving pulling action. Pultrusion is a continuous process for manufacturing composites with constant cross-section. The picture shows basic steps of pultrusion process. ![source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:LaurensvanLieshout](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Pultrusion_process_01.png)

These 7 steps are:
<br>
1 – Continuous roll of reinforced fibers/woven fiber mat<br>
2 – Tension roller<br>
3 – Resin Impregnator<br>
4 – Resin soaked fiber<br>
5 – Die and heat source<br>
6 – Pull mechanism<br>
7 – Finished hardened fiber reinforced polymer<br>

Besides the usual steps, there was an additional step in our setup consisting of a saw to cut the planks into a selected length. A limit switch was placed at the end of the production line to acheive this result. 

We helped to manufacture composites of carbon fiber paired with several combinations of epoxy and resins. Two companies, each of which produced resin and epoxy collaborated with each other to carry out compressive strength tests for use in aerospace and automotive purposes. Several batches of carbon fiber planks were manufactured over the period of three days and taken to lab for testing.

I had an amazing experience working in the lab and being able to indepedently learn the process of pultrusion. Dr. Lackey is a great person to work with; she provides good guidance and instructions at the same time gives freedom to make own decisions in the steps you are responsible for. She plans to carry out similar projects in coming weeks. I cannot wait to get back in the lab again.
