Recently I joined the Composite Research Lab at the University of Mississippi to work on a pultrusion project. Pultrusion combines the words "Pull" and "Extrusion". Hence, it is a process involving pulling action. Pultrusion is a continuous process for manufacturing composites with constant cross-section. The picture shows basic steps of pultrusion process. ![source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:LaurensvanLieshout](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Pultrusion_process_01.png)

These 7 steps are:
<br>
1 – Continuous roll of reinforced fibers/woven fiber mat<br>
2 – Tension roller<br>
3 – Resin Impregnator<br>
4 – Resin soaked fiber<br>
5 – Die and heat source<br>
6 – Pull mechanism<br>
7 – Finished hardened fiber reinforced polymer<br>
