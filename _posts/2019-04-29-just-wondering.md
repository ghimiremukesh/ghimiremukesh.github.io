With summer almost around the corner, it's time to think about what to do for a long (not so long) and sweaty 3 months. It is obviously very late to think about it now, but better late than never. As of now there isn't much things going on in my mind, so, I can focus on this. My initial thought was to study for GRE, and make some progress on my airfoil research. However, it also hit me that I need to eat and find a place to stay in Oxford while I do that; and I need money for that; and a job to get money; **Oh god!** Life is a mess!
