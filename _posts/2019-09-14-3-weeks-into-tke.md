Whew! time flies by so fast. I cannot believe I've already spent 3 weeks at the thyssenkrupp elevator manufacturing in Middle-of-Nowhere, TN (just kidding, its actually Middleton, TN but you get what I'm trying to say) trying to learn everything that goes into elevator manufacturing. I took the job as an engineering CO-OP earlier in August after going through some interviews. I was skeptic at first since taking this opportunity meant delaying my graduation by a year! A year! But upon careful consideration and thinking and advising I finally realized that I wouldn't necessarily be losing a year. I would be learning to put my knowledge to test, utilize it to actually do things that I was meant to do in the first place. With several such reassurances I finally accepted the position. My first day was August 27, 2019.

Having spent about 21 days already, I've had numerous different experiences in the plant. I have been amazed, and terrified at the same time. I had never in my life seen any magnificent factory of such in action. Of course I have watched countless episodes of Megafactories in the National Geographic Channel growing up but its a way different feeling to see it in person. 

On the first day I had a brief tour of the facility. I got to see all the autonomous robots in action, huge lasers and plasma devices that operated 24 hours punching and cutting sheet metals (I'll drop a video at the end). On top of that I could overhear people talk about several manufacturing plant jargons: ECOs, SOPs, MRB, Kaizan, 6 Sigma (I knew that one), Lean, Leed, Kanban... and a lot more. I was clueless to what all those meant. However, I didn't let that overwhelm me, it was only my first day. I was paired with a machine shop engineer for the first week. Every now and then I would try to ask him what each of those words meant. He was generous enough to answer all of my questions in a calm manner. 

I was amazed to see the amount of work that went to the elevator production. Several production lines working independently to meet their deadlines while maintaining a safe working environment. If one production line was to shut down production for some reason, it could have a huge domino effect eventually shutting down the whole production leading into huge backlog.
