Whew! time flies by so fast. I cannot believe I've already spent 3 weeks at the thyssenkrupp elevator manufacturing in Middle-of-Nowhere, TN (just kidding, its actually Middleton, TN but you get what I'm trying to say) trying to learn everything that goes into elevator manufacturing. I took the job as an engineering CO-OP earlier in August after going through some interviews. I was skeptic at first since taking this opportunity meant delaying my graduation by a year! A year! But upon careful consideration and thinking and advising I finally realized that I wouldn't necessarily be losing a year. I would be learning to put my knowledge to test, utilize it to actually do things that I was meant to do in the first place. With several such reassurances I finally accepted the position. My first day was August 27, 2019.

Having spent about 21 days already, I've had numerous different experiences in the plant. I have been amazed, and terrified at the same time. I had never in my life seen any magnificent factory of such in action. Of course I have watched countless episodes of Mega Factory in the National Geographic Channel growing up but its a way different feeling to see it in person.
